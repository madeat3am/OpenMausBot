# OpenMausBot connected-apps broker

This Worker keeps the shared Composio project key out of desktop builds. Each
installation receives a random bearer token stored only as a SHA-256 hash in
D1. The Worker gives that installation its own Composio user/session, proxies
MCP traffic, and returns short-lived Connect Links to the local app.

The desktop never receives the project key. Authorization links are returned
only on demand and are never persisted in chat messages.

Existing account aliases can be repaired through the authenticated
`PATCH /v1/connectors/:toolkit/accounts/:accountId` broker route. OpenMausBot
exposes that operation only to a direct loopback host operator; it is not part
of the connector MCP or any bot tool surface. The broker proves the account
belongs to the installation's stable Composio user and toolkit, applies one
exact alias, and requires provider readback before reporting success.

Deployment for this repository:

1. `pnpm broker:types`
2. `pnpm exec wrangler d1 migrations apply openmausbot-composio --remote --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc`
3. For an existing Worker, run `pnpm exec wrangler secret put COMPOSIO_API_KEY --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc`, then `pnpm broker:deploy`.
4. For the very first deploy, put `COMPOSIO_API_KEY=...` in the ignored `.dev.vars.production` file and run `pnpm exec wrangler deploy --config cloudflare/composio-broker/wrangler.jsonc --secrets-file .dev.vars.production`. Delete the file immediately afterward.

Forks should create their own D1 database and rate-limit namespaces, replace
the IDs in `wrangler.jsonc`, deploy under their own Worker name, and set
`OMB_COMPOSIO_BROKER_URL` in their packaged build. Running only the local
server with a Composio project key remains the no-Cloudflare self-host path.

Set `REGISTRATION_MODE` to `closed` to stop issuing new installation tokens
without affecting existing users.
